# Space Invaders game

## About this game

This is the first game I made in Pygame. 
I built this game with the help of 2 great tutorials, combined with my own ideas.
The tutorials I used are:
Tech with Tim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM
buildwithpython (via freeCodeCamp.org) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w
In main.py I give credit where I used images or lines of code from others.

## Game instruction

Use the arrow keys to move your spaceship up, down, right or left.
Use the space bar to shoot bullets at the enemies.
The circles in the bottom right corner of the screen represent the health you have left.
